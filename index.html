      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h2>
        Pleased to meet you. My name is Warren, I'm a Web Developer from the
        UK.
      </h2>
      <p>
        For the past 14 years I have worked in the Leisure industry as an educator
        of one form or another, but now I'm looking for a career change. I've been
        interested in programming for many years, but it wasn't until covid that
        I got into web development, when my dad asked me to build his jazz band a
        new website. This was my first introduction to web development, and I
        haven't looked back since!
      </p>

      <p>
        In my current job I am surrounded by people who rely on computers to do their work
        but aren't very "tech-savy", which results in them getting slowed down by the software
        they are being told to use. Don't get me wrong, the software they have is very cleaver,
        but not very intuitive which causes a great deal of frustration in the office.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because of this, my design philosophy is to build clean, minimal UIs that
        anyone can use. I have found that sometimes the smallest details have a huge
        impact on the overall user experience. When I'm working on a project, I try
        to put myself in the shoes of the people I currently work with; People with a
        great many things to do, and no time to waste figuring out some finnicky piece
        of software.
      </p>

      <p id="skills-nav-position">
        I am passionate, curious and always strive for excellence in everything
        that I do. I love learning new things, sharing my skills and building
        tools that will benefit people. Making something that others can enjoyably
        use is worth all the hard work it takes to make it.

              I got sick of scrolling through page after page of "top 10
              anime" recommendation lists looking for my next anime binge, and
              never finding a decent match. So I created an app to help me.
              The app uses the
              <a href="https://jikan.moe/" target="_blank">Jikan API</a> that
              gets information from the MyAnimeList website. <br /><br />
              This project was the first time I've implemented page
              pagination, which was very important because depending on the
              filter settings, you could receive thousands of results from the
              API.

            <p>
              Lifeguards in the UK need to renew their qualification every 2
              years, which involves taking a theory exam. As someone who
              trains Lifeguards, this meant I would have to print out pages
              and pages of mock exam papers for candidates. Needless to say
              this is bad for the environment and wastes a lot of time, so I
              made an app to replace all those pieces of paper.
              <br /><br />
              The biggest challenge was correctly implementing the timers,
              which as it turns out is much harder in React than in vanilla
              JS.

              My first group project. We were tasked with creating a game for
              teaching people how boolean operators work. The user configures
              up to 4 bots to do battle in an arena. When one of the bots
              collides with another, their boolean operators and values are
              calculated to determine the winner.
              <br /><br />
              As this was my first time working with other people, it was
              initially a struggle because we all had slightly different
              coding styles. We managed to overcome this though and I'm very
              happy with the end result.
              <br />
              The project took us 6 weeks to complete.

              A commissioned project for a family member who is wanting to
              sell their artwork. Since they wanted to be able to add new art
              pieces in the future, I decided to build the app in NextJS and
              use Contentful for the CMS. This was the first time working to a
              client's specification, with the goal of accommadating their
              wishes as much as possible.
              <br /><br />
              The client's choice of colours was tricky to work with but I
              feel it turned out quite well, and I'm very happy with the
              frontpage layout.

              I needed a convenient way to track my spending. However all
              the pre-built apps I could find were way too overkill for what
              I needed, so I built my own which I now use every day. This
              app uses the MERN stack with Typescript on the frontend.
              <br /><br />
              It includes user authentication, allows the user to add new
              expenses and then see their total expenses for each week or
              each month.
              <br /><br />
              Right now it's pretty basic, but it does exactly what I need
              it to. I hope to add more features to it in the future.

              admins to change the background images at will without it
              breaking. Getting the band members gallery to look good with a
